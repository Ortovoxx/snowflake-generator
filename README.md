# Snowflake generator

This small project was for COMP1202 Programming 1 at the University of Southampton end of Christmas term challenge.

It does what it says on the tin and generates snowflakes in SVG form.

## Inspiration

[This](https://www.misha.studio/snowflaker/) snowflake generator served as my initial inspiration and you can probably see the similarities.
I tried looking for the source code but couldn't find anything so I ended up just using it for design inspiration.
Their solution was quite basic so I developed on it further.

[This codegolf solution](https://github.com/codegolf/snowflake) generates snowflakes using only 190 bytes of HTML and JavaScript which was very impressive.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
